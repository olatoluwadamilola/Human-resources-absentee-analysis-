# Human Resources Absentee Analysis 
## Project overview 

The HR Absentee Dashboard is a comprehensive visualization tool designed to analyze and monitor employee absenteeism within an organization. Created using Power BI, this dashboard provides insights into various factors contributing to absenteeism, including seasonal trends, age group distribution, social behaviors, health status, and reasons for absences. The goal is to identify patterns and underlying causes of absenteeism to develop effective strategies for improving employee attendance and overall workplace productivity.

 2. Which month had the highest number of absenteeisms logged in the second-highest season, and how 
many absenteeisms were reported?
 3. There is a month 0 that was reported three times for absenteeism. What was the reason for these 
absenteeisms?
 4. How many family-related absenteeisms were reported?
 5. Which code was the highest reported reason for family-related absenteeism, and how many were 
logged for this code?

value of less than 90 disregarded disciplinary warnings.

## Result
1.	Total Employees;
o	Metric: 37 employees
o	Analysis: Provides the overall employee count, serving as a reference for understanding the scale of absenteeism.
2.	Absenteeism Reasons per Season
o	Metric: Total absences by season (Autumn: 144, Spring: 195, Summer: 159, Winter: 141)
o	Analysis: Indicates that Spring has the highest absenteeism, suggesting possible seasonal factors like allergies or spring break.

o	Analysis: Obesity is most common among adults, indicating a potential health-related cause for absenteeism.
6.	Absenteeism by Day of the Week
o	Metric: Absenteeism trends from Monday to Friday
o	Analysis: Shows a decreasing trend in absenteeism from Monday (147) to Friday (107), which may be linked to factors like work fatigue or personal commitments.

## Recommendations ;
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1.	Health and Wellness Programs: Implement programs to address health issues, particularly focusing on obesity and other medical conditions prevalent among adults.
2.	Flexible Work Policies: Consider introducing flexible work arrangements, especially during high absenteeism seasons like Spring, to accommodate personal needs and reduce absenteeism.
3.	Employee Engagement: Develop initiatives to engage young adults, addressing their high rates of smoking and drinking, which may contribute to absenteeism.
4.	Targeted Interventions: Focus on the most common reasons for absenteeism, such as medical reasons, and provide better healthcare support and resources to employees.
5.	Monitor Trends: Regularly update and monitor the dashboard to track changes in absenteeism patterns and the effectiveness of implemented policies.
